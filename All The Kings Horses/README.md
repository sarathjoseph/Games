<b>RULES </b>

A number of versions of this game are described in Conway's "On Numbers and Games", but we will play one specific version not described exactly there.
In this two-player game, each player has control of two chess knights on a chessboard (which can be of any size). On your turn, you must move one of your knights toward the upper-left corner of the board. In general, this means that four moves are available:



Of course, if a knight is near the top or left of the board, fewer moves will be possible, and a knight in the upper left 2x2 area cannot move at all. For this reason, the board can be considered to extend infinitely far down and to the right without the state space becoming infinitely large. In addition, a knight is not allowed to move to a square occupied by another knight (of either color). You lose the game if you are unable to make a move. As such, this game has no draws.
